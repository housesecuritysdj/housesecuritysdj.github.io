<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

Professional installation varieties from $350 to $1,200 depending on how extensive you 'd like your system to be. If you likewise sign up for their monitoring services, many companies offer plan offers that consist of installation with a main wireless system.</p>
