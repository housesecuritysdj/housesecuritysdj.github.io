<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends out signals directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide array of features including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the road. Not fantastic, not awful, but with a really easy setup procedure (and trust me, that actually is a killer function when it comes to clever cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
