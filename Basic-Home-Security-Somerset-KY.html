<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Outdoor security cameras are normally more costly than their indoor equivalents. They can vary in price from around $100 as much as $400 depending upon features. There are a lot of budget friendly cameras readily available that deal good video efficiency, but just like almost any smart device, you'll pay more for functions such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage choices, and rechargeable battery power. </p>
