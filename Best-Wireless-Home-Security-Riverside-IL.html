<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
