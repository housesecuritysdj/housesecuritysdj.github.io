<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files offering performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are just 2 options. The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or not available to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system.
