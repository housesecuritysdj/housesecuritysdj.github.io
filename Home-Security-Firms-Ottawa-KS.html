<p>On the surface area, these two camera categories might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the distinctions become distinct and apparent. Commercial-grade cameras are created and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.

The video recorder should be purchased separately, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (United States $) and can range as much as $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>
<h3>The Best Home Security System in Kansas</h3>

<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files offering performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are just 2 options. The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or not available to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system.
