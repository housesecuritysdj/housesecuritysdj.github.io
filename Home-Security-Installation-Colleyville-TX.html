<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
