<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more costly for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years.
