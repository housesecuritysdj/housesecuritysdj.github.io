I am so delighted that you have actually pointed out about clever home combination Just last week I was offered lot of cameras to install by a property owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras suitable with his home automation systems. So we had to acquire new cameras.</p>

In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
