<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with 4 white and streamlined bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and smart IR to supply up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

We are validating with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, and so we might review this review.</p>
