<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
