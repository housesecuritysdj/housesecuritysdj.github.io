<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be a budget friendly option for consumers in rural areas.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
