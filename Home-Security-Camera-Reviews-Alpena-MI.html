<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This meant every door and window needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>A few of the lower-quality home security systems include just basic windows and door sensors that customers can quickly install themselves.

Some systems store recorded video in your area on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others use cloud storage. In your area saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget, however you have to take care not to overwrite video you may require later. Cloud storage makes it simple to store and gain access to taped video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending on your subscription. Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some supply a devoted storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that occurred at a specific point in time.</p>
