<h3>Security Systems For Your Home Clackamas OR 97015</h3>

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights head out. </p>
