<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth gadgets are not safe from hacking and should be considered a security danger. Even barcode readers, portable PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers should be secured. These non-traditional networks can be quickly overlooked by IT personnel who have actually narrowly concentrated on laptop computers and gain access to points.</p>
