<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing watching outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same person could position a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the privacy of their home.

Having the ability to compare a car and a person, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
