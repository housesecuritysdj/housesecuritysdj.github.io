<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
