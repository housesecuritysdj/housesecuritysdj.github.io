<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
