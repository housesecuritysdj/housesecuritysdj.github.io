<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the specialists and ought to be teaching their consumers how to effectively set and care for their alarm. National and local statistics have shown that raising fines paid straight by businesses and homeowners have actually had no substantial influence on reducing the variety of incorrect alarms.
