<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

In our testing, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may revisit this evaluation.</p>
