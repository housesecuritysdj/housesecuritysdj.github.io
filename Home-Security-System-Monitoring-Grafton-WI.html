<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential. In reality, we don't recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to compare a cars and truck and a person, for instance, permits you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
