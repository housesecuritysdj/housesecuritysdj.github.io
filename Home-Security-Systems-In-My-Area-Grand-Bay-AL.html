Some systems can be configured to allow deactivation of individual sensing units or groups.  High-end systems allow several gain access to codes, and may even allow them to be utilized only as soon as, or on specific days, or just in combination with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied).

As with gain access to codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heating system repairperson to go into the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that allow a pressure code to be gone into and silence the local alarm, however still activate the remote alarm to summon the authorities to a burglary.</p>

The greatest photo quality of DVD is only a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
