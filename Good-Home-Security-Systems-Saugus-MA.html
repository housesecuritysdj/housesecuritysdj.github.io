We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>

Our tester stated the service technician supplied solid customer support: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensors from my expense after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
