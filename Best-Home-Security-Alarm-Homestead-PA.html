<h3>Home Alarm System Monitoring in Homestead PA</h3>
<p>In short, the expansion of surveillance cameras has rapidly decreased our ability to maintain privacy in public areas; and the advent of automated face acknowledgment and other tracking technologies just accelerate this risk to personal privacy.
