On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other clever home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
