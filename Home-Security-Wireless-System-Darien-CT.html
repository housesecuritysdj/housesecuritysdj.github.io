The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are plainly not hindered by camera - and may even be attracted to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the minimal advantages that the system might supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
