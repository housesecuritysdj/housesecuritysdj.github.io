We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
