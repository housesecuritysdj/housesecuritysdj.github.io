<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary authorities and fire responses.

Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and except a basic power blackout, are more difficult to interrupt. Despite a general enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and paralyzed. </p>
