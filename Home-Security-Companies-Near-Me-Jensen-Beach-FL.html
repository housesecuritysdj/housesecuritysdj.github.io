<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary authorities and fire responses.

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and bad connection are still common complaints. Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and except a basic power blackout, are more difficult to interrupt. Despite a general enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and paralyzed. </p>
