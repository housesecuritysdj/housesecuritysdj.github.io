<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store.

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
