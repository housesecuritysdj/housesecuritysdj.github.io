<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from approximately four cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and uncomfortable to use on celebration - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit easier to undermine for prospective intruders.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
