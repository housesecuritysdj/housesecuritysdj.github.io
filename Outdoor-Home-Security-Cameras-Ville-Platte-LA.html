<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
