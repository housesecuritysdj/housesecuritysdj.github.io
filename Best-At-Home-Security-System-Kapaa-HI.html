<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was uncomplicated and quite darn smooth. Otherwise, this company provides a similar feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why numerous individuals are selecting this choice. </p>
