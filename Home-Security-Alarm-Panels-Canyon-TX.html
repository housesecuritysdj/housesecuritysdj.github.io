<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being seen understand they're being seen, and you can select to tape-record video clips or photos and conserve them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
